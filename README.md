## visualizing Weighted Social Network model

This application visualizes a time evolution of social network formation using a weighted social network model.
The simulation is based on the model proposed by Kumpula et al. (http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.228701)

You'll see how community structures are developed.

## How to run

- First of all, you need [processing](http://processing.org/).
- The code depends on [toxiclibs](http://toxiclibs.org/).
    - From the menu of Processing, [Sketch]-[Import library]-[Add library]. Search for toxiclibs and install it.
- Open `weighted_social_network_model.pde` in processing, and run it.
